 * The rules are written as one chain of if and elseif per field, so which one
 * answers for a value depends on the ones beside it. Reading the code back
 * says the rules are there; only running it says the right one answers. So
 * the classes are generated where they can be loaded, the tables are migrated
 * from the same Models, and a request is put through them.
 *
 * Every case starts from a request that validates clean and spoils one field,
 * which is what keeps the case about the rule it is named after.
